Webathena is an experiment to bring Project Athena and particularly
Kerberos to the web. It is a JavaScript Kerberos client, paired with a
simple server-side KDC proxy which wraps the Kerberos protocol in
HTTP. The tickets are stored locally in HTML localStorage. It provides
a cross-origin protocol using postMessage to forward service tickets
to web applications needing access to the user's credentials.

Webathena is written by David Benjamin and Alan Huang of the MIT
Student Information Processing Board.
