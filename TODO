- Deal with the not enough entropy problem

- Figure out the right parameters for our tickets

- Hook up service tickets to UI

- Store TGT session persistently

- OAuth-like thing to pass between origins

- Demo of zwrite.js or similar

- Various X-Secure-Me-Harder headers

  - X-Frame-Options on the relevant pages

  - X-Content-Security / X-WebKit-CSP

  - X-XSS-Protection - need to set hard fail

  - X-Content-Type-Options - disable content sniffing; may as well

  - Would be good to avoid specifying this twice for Apache and the
    test server. I guess test_server.py could have a very basic
    .htaccess parser? Also the test server likely wants HSTS turned
    off.

- Figure out cross-realm stuff. Just ignoring it for now.
